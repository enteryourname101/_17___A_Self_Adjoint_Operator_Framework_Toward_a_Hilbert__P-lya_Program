# A Self-Adjoint Operator Framework Toward a Hilbert–Pólya Program

## Overview

This document provides the most foundational operator-theoretic framework in the series.
It constructs an explicit symmetric arithmetic operator and analyzes its domain,
self-adjoint extensions, and deficiency indices.

---

## Core Achievement

The obstruction to a Hilbert–Pólya-type program is reduced to a single explicit
deficiency equation.

All assumptions and limitations are made fully explicit.

---

## What Is Established

- Explicit Hilbert space and dense domain
- Symmetry of the operator
- Lower semibounded quadratic form
- Existence of a canonical Friedrichs extension

---

## What Remains Open

- Essential self-adjointness
- Vanishing of deficiency indices
- Spectral identification with zeta zeros

---

## Logical Structure

- No assumptions of the Riemann Hypothesis
- Conditional implications only
- No circular reasoning

---

## Position in the Program

This document is the mathematical anchor of the entire SMRK program.
All experimental and conjectural steps depend on its framework.

---

## Status

- Fully rigorous
- Conservative in claims
- Program-defining
- Incomplete by design
